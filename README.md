# How drug like is that drug name?

This project is a toy application skeleton calculating the drug likeness of a suggested drug name in line with the work at ["Relative frequencies of letters in drug names"](http://www.bgcarlisle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/15.09.01_Letter_frequencies.html). For more information see the [app page itself].

The app is based on the [angular-seed project](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)
